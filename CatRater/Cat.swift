     Implement saving and loading a Cat here. Using the NSCoding approach, the Cat class is in charge of storing and loading each of its properties.
     It needs to save its data by assigning the value of each property to a particular key. It then loads the data by looking up the information associated with that key. 
     To make it clear which coding key corresponds to each piece of data, create a structure to store the key strings. 
     Then when I need to use the key, can use the constant instead of retyping the string.
