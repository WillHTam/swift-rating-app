// Didn't use 'Cocoa Touch Class' like for Ratingcontrol because this is a base class (no Superclass) for the data model which doesn't need to inherit from any other classes.

import UIKit
// Changed from Foundation, since we need UIKit Framework methods here. Importing UIKit also gives access to Foundation.

    //MARK: Properties
    // not let because they will need to change
    var name: String

    //MARK: Initialization
        // Initializers are methods that prepare an instance of a class for use, which involves setting an initial value for each property and doing any other setup
        // Use init? ( or init!) because only failable initializers can return optional values (which can be valid or nil), or implicitly unwrapped  optional values. Then the optional must be checked & safely unwrapped or implicitly unwrapped.
        // Could use assert() or preconditon() to terminate the app if their conditions fail.
    
    init?(name: String, photo: UIImage?, rating: Int) {
        // Initialization should fail if there is no name or if the rating is negative
        // This code below (Lines 30-32) fails the Unit test for a rating of 6, which should be invalid but is not covered by this if statement
//        if name.isEmpty || rating < 0 {
//            return nil
//        }
