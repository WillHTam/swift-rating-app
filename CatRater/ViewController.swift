// Since we added the stars programatically, Interface Builder doesn't know anything about the contents of the Traing Control. To fix define control as @IBDesignable, which lets IB instantiate and draw a copy of the control directly in the canvas. Then a live copy will be available for IB to properly position and size.

    // Image (3rd) has no interaction component, if ctrl-dragged 'Action' is not available. Thus a gesture recognizer must be created.
    // Gesture recognizers are objects you attach to a view that respond to input like a control. Gesture recognizers interpret touches and determine whether they correspond to an action like a swipe pinch or rotation
    // Added a 'Tap Gesture Recognizer' from the object library
