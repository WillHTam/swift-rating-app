#### Things I learned this time
- [What to do if references to the Class are lost](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17735182/could-not-find-any-information-for-class-named-viewcontroller/27578662#27578662)
- Making the View Controller a delegate for Text Fields and Image Picking
- Making Action (rather than Outlet) connections to the Interface Builder
- Making an object a FirstResponder
- Attaching methods to different responses to actions (i.e. setting text to the contents of a text field within 'func textFieldDidEndEditing()'
- Attaching a Gesture Recognizer to an image
- Using IBDesignable on a class that IB can't see
- Using IBInspectable to let IB control the attributes
- Understanding that some segues that I thought might be applied automaticallly actually have to be manually connected
- Gave Button objects Property Observers
- Set Button images with button.setImage and traitCollection
- UI Elements like a 5-Star rating system, customizing keyboard elements
- Setting accessibiltyLabel, Hint, & Value to enable VoiceOver for people with disabilities
- Nearly went insane reading and writing the word 'cat' so many times
- Adding objects to a stack view to auto-group them in the UI and then using attributes and pin/constraints to position them. Also auto-resolving frames often.
- Created a data model which stores the information that is displayed
- Made a failable initializer for the class which could return nil
- Made Unit tests
- Reviewed creating a second storyboard scene and table view
- Displayed dynamic data in a table view
- Adding assets to the project
- Created custom table view cell
- Attached model object to table view controller
- Added sample data to the model, and used the controller to dynamically fill the table with the model data
- Added segues and unwind segues with IB and prepare(for segue:)
- Pass data across segues
- Make private functions with guard
- Push scenes onto the navigation stack
- Present views modally and how to dismiss modals
- Persist data between app sessions with NSCoding
- Encode/decode from storage, add NSCoding to model and table view controller
