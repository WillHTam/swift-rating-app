#### Things I learned this time
- Making the View Controller a delegate for Text Fields and Image Picking
- Making Action (rather than Outlet) connections to the Interface Builder
- Making an object a FirstResponder
- Attaching methods to different responses to actions (i.e. setting text to the contents of a text field within 'func textFieldDidEndEditing()'
- Attaching a Gesture Recognizer to an image
- Using IBDesignable on a class that IB can't see
- Using IBInspectable to let IB control the attributes
- Gave Button objects Property Observers
- Set Button images with button.setImage and traitCollection
- UI Elements like a 5-Star rating system, customizing keyboard elements
- Setting accessibiltyLabel, Hint, & Value to enable VoiceOver for people with disabilities
- Adding objects to a stack view to auto-group them in the UI and then using attributes and pin/constraints to position them. Also auto-resolving frames often.
- Created a data model which stores the information that is displayed
- Made a failable initializer for the class which could return nil
- Made Unit tests
- Reviewed creating a second storyboard scene and table view
- Displayed dynamic data in a table view
